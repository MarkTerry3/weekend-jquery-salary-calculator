# Salary Calculator


## Description


I made a salary calculator. It solves the problem of not knowing what your spending each month on your employees. It lets you input all of your employees data, including annual salary. It then breaks down your monthly costs for all employees to know exactly what the company is spending each month. If your spending more than $20,000 a month, the monthly total will turn red.
